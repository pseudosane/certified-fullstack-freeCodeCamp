        <h1>Perfect Days</h1>

            The story follows Hirayama (played by Koji Yakusho), a middle-aged man who works as a public toilet cleaner
            in Tokyo’s Shibuya district. His daily routine is simple and deliberate: brewing canned coffee,
            playing old cassette tapes, driving his van stocked with cleaning supplies, and carefully washing the toilets.
            <br><br>
            Though his life seems monotonous, each day is unique — he takes time to photograph leaves, tend to small plants, read, and enjoy music.                
            Unexpected events begin to subtly disrupt his calm routine, stirring memories of the past and gently altering the rhythm of his life.
