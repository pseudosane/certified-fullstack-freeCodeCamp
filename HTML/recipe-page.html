    <h1>Fried Rice Recipe</h1>
    <p>This is a quick, 15 minute fried rice recipe that’s highly versatile.
        Terrific as it is, but totally adaptable to add what you want.
        I’ve used egg and a basic mix of frozen chopped vegetables – 
        because I totally buy into the whole “snap frozen” thing and
        this is intended to be super quick ‘n easy. Just carrots, peas and corn 
        (still frozen, don’t even need to thaw).
But don’t let my laziness influence you! Feel free to use fresh veggies – 
        whatever you want. Try adding proteins like chicken, shrimp/prawns, tofu.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked cold rice (day old is best)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen mixed vegetables (corn, peas, carrots)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped green onions for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Sauté flavour base</b> – Start by sautéing onion, garlic and bacon</li>
        <li><b>Add diced vegetables</b> – I’ve used frozen corn, carrots and peas for convenience here, but any diced vegetables will be great</li>
        <li><b>Add <i>cooked cold rice</i> and sauce</b> and give it a toss</li>
        <li><b>Move everything to the side and scramble egg</b> in the work or pan. It sounds cheeky, but actually, this is a technique common in Thai Stir Fries, like in the ever popular Pad See Ew. It works great!</li>
        <li>Add green onion and toss it all together, then serve immediately!</li>
    </ol>
